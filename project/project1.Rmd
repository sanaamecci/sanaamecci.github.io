I have chosen two datasets from R packages accessed through tidytuesday 
via GitHub regarding college tuition, diversity, and pay (tuition income) 
and US spending on kids (kids). My aim was to analyze wether or not the 
yearly amount of public spending on kids and public spending per child, 
both adjusted for inflation, is inversely related to the yearly total 
cost of college attendance and the net cost paid by students after 
scholarships and awards. Before condensing the datasets, the kids dataset 
contained 3 categorical and 3 numerical variables. The kids dataset contains 
an account of public spending on children from 1997 through 2016 to analyze 
state-testate spending on education, income security health, etc. The college 
tuition data originally came from the US Department of Education from 2010 to 2016. 
The tuition income dataset contained 5 categorical and 2 numerical variables. These 
datasets in particular are interesting to me because I’ve always been hyperaware 
both of how expensive tuition is for college students such as myself and how 
little funding public schools received and was wondering if both, since 
they receive public/government funding, are correlated. I am anticipating
that as the yearly amount of public spending on kids increases, the cost of 
tuition will decrease because the government will funnel more money into college 
education.

```{r cars}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(corrplot)
library(cluster)

tuition_income <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_income.csv') 
kids <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/kids.csv')

drop <- c("state", "variable", "raw")
kids1=kids[,!(names(kids)%in%drop)]

drop1 <- c("name", "state", "campus")
tuition1=tuition_income[,!(names(tuition_income)%in%drop1)]


kids2<- kids1 %>% filter(year %in% (2010:2016))
tuition2 <- tuition1 %>% filter(year %in% (2010:2016))

set.seed(1000)

cost <- full_join(kids2%>% sample_frac(.12184), tuition2%>% sample_frac(.006462), by="year")
view(cost)

```
First, from the kids dataset I dropped the cases “state”, “variable, and 
“raw” and the variables “name”, “state”, and “campus” to minimize the combined 
data set to 6 variables in total: 2 categorical and 4 numerical. I then proceeded 
to filter both datasets to condense the data to between the years of 2010 and 2016 
since that is all that was reported on by the tuition income dataset. Before 
combining the datasets, since my dataset was very large and thus unable to work 
with, I set the seed and used sample frac to get a random sample of 1000 rows 
before performing a full join on my two datasets by the common categorical variable 
year to return all of the data into a singular dataset named cost.
```{r}
summary(cost)

cost2<-cost%>%group_by(year)%>%dplyr::summarize(inf_adj, inf_adj_perchild, total_price, net_cost, income_lvl, meaninf=mean(inf_adj),
meanper=mean(inf_adj_perchild), meantotal=mean(total_price), meannet=mean(net_cost)) 

cost2%>%arrange(desc(inf_adj))%>%filter(year=="2016")%>%dplyr::summarize(meantotal=mean(total_price),
                                                                        meannet=mean(net_cost))

cost%>%filter(year=="2014")%>%dplyr::summarize(meantotal=mean(total_price), meannet=mean(net_cost))
```
In order to explore and manipulate my dataset, I used six different dplyr functions and 
ran various summary statistics. I began by first grouping my dataset by year and proceeded 
by summarizing the mean values for government spending adjusted for inflation, the adjusted 
inflation value per child, the total cost of tuition, and the net cost of tuition. While it 
looked like there was a general increase in the variables mean inflation, mean total, and 
mean total, the data was still too scattered to conclude a solid correlation between the 
variables. To continue in testing this relationship, I narrowed in on the year where the 
mean inflation was the highest, 2016, and the lowest, 2014, and compared both years against 
the mean total and mean net values. I found that for the year with higher inflation, 2016, 
the mean total and mean net was also higher (mean total of 31,547 and mean net of 17,003) 
compared to 2014.

## Including Plots
```{r}
cost%>%dplyr::select(inf_adj, inf_adj_perchild, total_price, net_cost)%>% cor()
cost%>%group_by(year)%>%dplyr::select(inf_adj, inf_adj_perchild, total_price, net_cost)%>%summarize_all(sd)

cost2 <- cost %>% dplyr::mutate(meaninf=mean(inf_adj), meanper=mean(inf_adj_perchild),
                                meantotal=mean(total_price), meannet=mean(net_cost), difference = total_price - net_cost)
```
I then proceeded by performing a correlation test between the inflated value, the inflated
value per child, the total price, and net cost. I found that the variables that came from
either dataset, tuition or kids, before they were combined had a slight correlatation but 
when compared against each other, the variables with the value for the adjusted inflation 
and the total price had a a very weak correlation of 0.001889 and -0.004152 for the total
price compared against the adjusted inflation value per child. I then grouped the values
from both datasets by year and created summary statistics by grouping the numerical
variables by the categorical variable year. Then, I mutated my orinal dataset cost to
add a new column difference to see if it is increasing with every year which would support
my initial hypothesis that the government is increasing financial aid towards educational 
programs (towards scholarships) with every increasing year along with public spending.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
cors<-cost%>%select_if(is.numeric)%>%cor()
cors%>%as.data.frame%>%
  rownames_to_column%>%pivot_longer(-1)%>%na.omit%>% 
  ggplot(aes(rowname,name,fill=value))+geom_tile()+ geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)))+ 
  xlab("")+ylab("")+coord_fixed()+ scale_fill_gradient2(low="red",mid="white", high="blue")

```
Creating a correlation heatmap of my numeric variables, there was a slight correlation of 
0.11 and 0.03 of both the total price and the net cost of tuition variables from the tuition
dataset against the year. However, I am able to conclude that there is no correlation between 
the variables between two datasets tuition income and kids as most of the values were 0 or 
negatively correlated.

```{r}
ggplot(cost, aes(year))+ geom_bar(aes(y=total_price, fill=income_lvl), stat="summary")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+ggtitle("Total Cost of Tuition per Year")+ylab("Total Cost in USD")+xlab("Year")

ggplot(data = cost, aes(x = year, y = inf_adj)) + geom_point(size=.1, aes(color = income_lvl)) +ggtitle("Public Spending per Year")+ylab("Public Spending on Kids")+xlab("Year")


p=cost %>%dplyr::select_if(is.numeric) %>% scale
rownames(p)<-cost$year
money<-princomp(p)
summary(money, loadings=T)
eigval<-money$sdev^2
round(cumsum(eigval)/sum(eigval),2)
eigval
eigen(cor(p))
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(money$scores[,1], money$scores[,2]))+xlab("PC1")+ylab("PC2")
```
I created a bargraph to compare the total cost of tuition per year in USD and found that
there was a gradual increase in the tuition cost per year and that the income levels also
were slightly correlated to tuition costs. I proceeded by creating a pointgraph to compare 
the public spending on kids per year. The public spending looks like it remained more or less
consistent and so I found that the results were not adequate enough to conclude a correlation
between public spending on kids and year. Furthermore, I found that since the points were 
overlapping and incomprehensible, the income level is not really a factor in public spending
towards kids. By running PCA on my numeric variables I was able to conclude that there is no
correlation between my variables since the points are so oddly clustered and structured and 
since most values were negative.
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
