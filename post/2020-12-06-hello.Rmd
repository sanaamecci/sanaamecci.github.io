So why would you ever need to use both Python AND R? Well, they are both widely used languages which have a large array of tools with different functions. R is a programming language for statistical computing and software whereas Python is a more general-purpose coding language which can be used for a wide variety programming and development. Now, you still might be unfamiliar with Python and wondering what kind of things we can do using the language --- look no further, here is an example!

#```{python}
#import pandas as pd
#poke <- pd.read_csv("http://www.nathanielwoodward.com/Pokemon.csv")
#poke.head()
#poke.iloc[:, :5]
#```
