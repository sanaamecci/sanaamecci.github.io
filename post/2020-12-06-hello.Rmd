So why would you ever need to use both Python AND R? Well, they are both widely used languages which have a large array of tools with different functions. R is a programming language for statistical computing and software whereas Python is a more general-purpose coding language which can be used for a wide variety programming and development. Now, you still might be unfamiliar with Python and wondering what kind of things we can do using the language --- look no further, here is an example!

```{python}
import pandas as pd
poke = pd.read_csv("http://www.nathanielwoodward.com/Pokemon.csv")
poke.head()
poke.iloc[:, :]
```

By looking at the Poke dataset in Python as a pandas dataframe, we can see that there are 800 observations of 13 different variables.

Moving on --- as seen below, the reticulate package in R allows you to run Python code in an R session. Both R and Python when used together can really streamline any programming project.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
super<-"This is how you use"
```

```{python}
easy="Python and R together"
print(r.super, easy)
```

Now you know why integrating Python into R can be beneficial to you in all of your coding endeavors! Enjoy the meme below, thanks for reading! :)
